# Farm-Buddy
Farm Buddy is a to-do app that lets you specify whether its a rainy day task, two-person tasks, due-dates, and more.

## About
This is a basic TODO app, but with a twist! 

The main goal of this job is to let you organize your tasks with access to quick filters. 

Right now the main property the app is tracking whether or not the task is weather-dependant. If it is, it will show up when the "weather" filter is toggled on. 

I plan on adding more booleans, like "is this a two-person job?", "is this a short/small task?" etc. 

Also, the data only persists in localStorage, but my goal is to have it be cross-platform so it can be used from phone or computer with no loss of data in between.
